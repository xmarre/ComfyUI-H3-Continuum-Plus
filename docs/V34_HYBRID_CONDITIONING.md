# V3.4 hybrid First / Last / Reference conditioning

V3.4 treats Reference Images and temporal keyframes as orthogonal MiniMax H3 conditioning.

## Contract

- `Reference Image 1..8` build persistent `minimax_refs` blocks and the Qwen reference presentation (`<Picture N>`).
- `First Frame` is a frame-0 keyframe guide and is presented to Qwen only for the initial physical sample.
- `Last Frame` is a keyframe guide at the final frame of the generated target.
- Connecting one or more Reference Images does **not** disable or discard First Frame or Last Frame.

This mirrors the Core H3 composition model: reference conditioning can be created first and keyframe guides can then be layered onto the same conditioning payload.

## Supported input combinations

| First Frame | Last Frame | Reference Image(s) | Temporal mode | Reference blocks |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| no | no | no | T2VA | none |
| yes | no | no | I2VA | none |
| no | yes | no | Last-only | none |
| yes | yes | no | FL2VA | none |
| no | no | yes | Reference | present |
| yes | no | yes | I2VA | present |
| no | yes | yes | Last-only | present |
| yes | yes | yes | FL2VA | present |

The temporal mode is used for keyframe and persistence semantics. Reference assets are fingerprinted separately and remain active whenever connected.

## Continuation methods

### Native Masked

For chunk 2 and later, the protected continuation prefix is copied into the new target latent and masked against denoising. The original First Frame is removed from both the temporal keyframe payload and the Qwen visual presentation because either channel can compete with the protected prefix or pull a later chunk back toward the opening composition. Persistent Reference blocks remain. A Last Frame keyframe remains on the final target because it is outside the protected prefix.

### Guide / Motion Context

For chunk 2 and later, Continuum context replaces the old frame-0 keyframe according to the normal recommended continuation policy. The original First Frame is also omitted from the Qwen visual presentation. Persistent Reference blocks remain, the continuation context reference is appended, and a final Last Frame keyframe is moved to the final frame of the expanded continuation target.

## Run Storage

Hybrid inputs are fingerprinted independently:

- First Frame participates in the global I2VA/FL2VA sampling contract, so changing it invalidates all stored chunks for that revision.
- Reference Images participate in the separate reference contract, so changing the active references invalidates the corresponding sampling revision.
- Last Frame participates in the final chunk contract, so changing only Last Frame preserves reusable earlier chunks and invalidates the final chunk.

This prevents a saved Reference run from reusing stale chunks after a hybrid First/Last keyframe changes.

## Dynamic references

The V3.4 public facade exposes Reference Image inputs through 8. Inputs 4..8 are compacted internally before entering the stable inherited sampler signature, without changing First/Last behavior. Active references retain connection order and are presented as contiguous `<Picture 1>..<Picture N>` references.
